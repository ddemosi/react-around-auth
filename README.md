# Around the U.S. Project AROUND-AUTH (Project 14)!
--------------------------------
### A "not as simple as it once was" ReactJS project with authentication for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:

* Could use a few transitions to clean up the nav bars.
* Overall the app.js file is pretty messy. Could definitely use some organization help, haha.
* Couldn't get the router to work on a static file. According to the internet, you have to configure the server to use routes, which I couldn't figure out with github pages.

Draft 2!

* Added default reroute so you can't navigate to a blank page.
* Updated states to be proper types.
* Updated all modal exit windows to close when promise is fulfilled.
* Updated input fields to hide the password.
* Moved login and register API requests to the App.js component.
