# Around the U.S. Project AROUND-EXPRESS (Project 13)!
--------------------------------
### Starting a server and building an API for Practicum by Yandex

Mostly there:

* All endpoints appear to be working
* Error handling could probably use some more work. I tried to find all the error names in the Mongoose documentation but couldn't find them.

Draft 2!

* Fixed destructuring issue with the getUserById function.
* Added additional error handling to the createUser function.

Draft 3!

* Fixed error handling on the getUserById handler.
* Updated card model to make the Link required.
* Updated errors in the card controllers to react to CastErrors.
* Updated primary routes so all unmatched endpoints return a 404 error.
* Removed leftover public folder and routes

Draft 4!

* Updated error handling on the CreateCard handler.


### Enjoy!
